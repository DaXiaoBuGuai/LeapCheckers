# LeapCheckers
Play checkers on the astroid belt against an invisible AI !

Use your own two hands to pick up the pieces.

Hit 'A' for AI mode, where red and black AIs play against each other.

Using Unity 5.6 and Leap Motion Core Assets: https://developer.leapmotion.com/unity

Game logic was ported from [gr33nfury/checkers](https://github.com/gr33nfury/checkers),
one reason for missing the double-jump functionality.
